## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented and explored various statistical concepts using Python. It includes examples of:

  - Measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode.
  - Measures of spread like range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation.
  - Probability distributions such as Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, and Normal distributions.
  - Inferential statistics such as sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
  - Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    
## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mshaadk/Statistics-Using-Python.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd Statistics-Using-Python
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Statistics Using Python.ipynb
```

## Key Topics Covered
### 1. Central Tendency
  - Mean: The average value of a dataset.
  - Median: The middle value in a dataset.
  - Mode: The most frequent value in a dataset.

### 2. Measures of Spread
  - Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
  - Interquartile Range (IQR): Spread of the middle 50% of the data.
  - Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
  - Standard Deviation: The square root of variance, indicating data spread.

### 3. Probability Distributions
  - Bernoulli Distribution
  - Binomial Distribution
  - Geometric Distribution
  - Poisson Distribution
  - Normal Distribution
    
### 4. Inferential Statistics
  - Sampling Distributions: Calculating sample means and comparing them to the population mean.
  - Central Limit Theorem (CLT): The distribution of the sample means approximates a normal distribution as sample size increases.

## Data Visualization
### Visualization Techniques
  - Scatter plots
  - Bar plots
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - KDE plots
  - Heatmaps
  - Pie charts
    
Each visualization technique is applied to datasets such as the Titanic dataset and custom-generated data for understanding statistical properties.

## Usage
Once you've set up the environment, you can run the notebook in any order or follow the sequential approach to explore different statistical concepts. Make sure to review and understand each block of code to gain insights into how Python handles statistical analysis.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics in Python.
- **SciPy**: For advanced statistical operations.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding fundamental statistical concepts and their implementation using Python. The combination of data analysis and visualization techniques will help you explore datasets, identify trends, and gain insights in a practical and meaningful way.
